I just learnt that in my melody generation project i used KRN file format which can be used for generation purposes but i am having an issue with fining Krn format datasets and so i am looking for diiferent sources to use it 
eg - librosa 

well i just read a good paper 
https://github.com/thamsuppp/MusicGenDL/blob/main/CIS%20522%20Final%20Report%20Github.pdf

linked above and this is uing a good technique call multi instrument RNNS and the content is pretty good with of course its own flaws and quirks like stated in the pdf 
there are 2 baseline structures used to make improvements upon , one being Transformers , based on a Transformer XL architecture and another one being RNNs (here they are not very useful but a baseline nonetheless)

I plan to use the transformer approach and research furthur on the same so that i can learn much more

I would also like to review some of the literature that is currently available right now and is withing the recent times
