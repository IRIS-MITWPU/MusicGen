# MusicGeneration
This is a research and learning project i plan to continue for the time being 
The aim of this project is to test , analyse and learn the working of sound bytes and the working of the sound in itself 

Dataset used ------->http://www.esac-data.org/

  the dataset used here is for the german language as it was the first one i looked at and followed with 
  I plan on using other asian languages and sound datasets to analyse sound generation for them specifially 

Tools Used -------->

  Music21 - a python package 
  
  anaconda
  
  git , vs code , pycharm , pyenv , muscore(4) , and packages like Tensorflow , Keras , json and numpy to name a few 
  also i plan on using a lot of research papers as my source of study and code-inspirations , so i will try and link them indivisually to make it 
  easier to find later on  

I plan on doing many things with this dataset such as using different parametres and working on improving my overall melody or efficiency as one would day.
I also plan on doing a lot more than sound generation in itself , such as sound analysis - providing a taste of music to the user or maybe even composer analysis 

My main aim is to do RESEARCH and by that term dont mean to invent nessesarily , but to find new usecases or to find a new way to implement a new method in this whole process to give the programmer an edge in performance and time and result optimzation.
